## This setting configures which "profile" dbt uses for this project.
#profile: 'oms_dbt_proj'
#
## These configurations specify where dbt should look for different types of files.
## The `model-paths` config, for example, states that models in this project can be
## found in the "models/" directory. You probably won't need to change these!

## Configuring models
## Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models
#
## In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
## directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
## files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

#  oms_dbt_proj:
